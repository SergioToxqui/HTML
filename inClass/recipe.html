        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <b>1.</b> - Combine the cheeses in a medium bowl.<br><br>
        <b>2.</b> - Heat a large frying pan over medium heat until hot,<br>
        about 3 minutes. Place a tortilla in the pan and sprinkle <br>
        with half of the chicken, half of the cilantro, and and half<br>
        of the cheese mixture. Top with a second tortilla and cook<br>
        until the underside of the bottom tortilla is golden brown <br>
        in several spots and half of the cheese is melted, about 3 <br>
        minutes. Using a spatula, carefully flip the quesadilla over<br>
        and cook until the underside of the second tortilla is crisp<br>
        and golden brown in several spots and all of the cheese is <br>
        melted, about 2 to 3 minutes more.<br><br>
        <b>3.</b>- Slide the quesadilla from the pan onto a cutting board<br>
        and cut into wedges. Repeat with the remaining ingredients<br>
        to make a second quesadilla. Serve topped with guacamole,<br>
        salsa, and sour cream, if desired.<br>
