        <div id="song">
            Yogi Bear is smarter than the average bear,<br>
            Yogi Bear is always in the ranger's hair.<br>
            At a picnic table you will find him there<br>
            Stuffing down more goodies than the average bear.<br>
            He will sleep till noon but before it's dark,<br>
            He'll have every picnic basket that's in Jellystone Park.<br>
            Yogi has it better than a millionaire<br>
            That's becasue he's smarter than the average bear.
